                    <li data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="1500">Promises to declare climate change a national emergency and put the Green New Deal into action by investing $16.3 trillion in a 10-year mobilization "that factors climate change into virtually every area of policy." That dollar figure is far higher than what other candidates are proposing.</li>

                    <li data-aos="zoom-in-up" data-aos-duration="2000">Warren struck early with a pledge in April to prohibit all new fossil fuel leases on public lands.</li>

                    <li data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="2000">Biden embraced the Green New Deal as a "crucial framework."</li>
                    <li data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="2000">Biden foresees $1.7 trillion in spending over the next 10 years, and $3.3 trillion in investments by the private sector and state and local governments.</li>
                    <li data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="2000">He wants Congress to pass emissions limits with "an enforcement mechanism ... based on the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting." He said it would include "clear, legally-binding emissions reductions," but did not give details.</li>
                    <li data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="2000">In July, Biden released a policy agenda that aims to boost the rural economy, in part by expanding a program that will pay farmers to use farming techniques that store carbon in the soil.</li>
                    <li data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="2000">His plan also calls for support for economically impacted communities. He was slow to agree with activists' calls for him to swear off campaign contributions from fossil fuel interests, but did sign the No Fossil Fuel Funding pledge on June 27.</li>
